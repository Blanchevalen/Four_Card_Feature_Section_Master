## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![Mobil view](./images/Mobil_view.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**I must admit, that was the first time,when i started the work with the mobil view. I am very excited because i finished the whole work a very shirt time (compared to myself) and i am pleased with the end result. Finally my code is cleaner than previously.**


### Continued development

**Note: That was my seventh newbie project. I finally finished it in a short time and I am satisfied with the result. Maybe i make a step from the newbie project to the junior project. I want to learn more! my javascript knowledge is rudimentary, and my CSS knowledge has plenty to improve as well. But today I am happy.**
